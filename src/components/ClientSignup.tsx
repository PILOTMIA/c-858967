          <p className="mb-4">
            It is entirely your choice whether you choose to trade using the chart set up sent, or whether you pick and choose a selection of them. Some people will place all of them, some people don't and this is personal preference. It all comes down to appropriate risk management as everybody is different, and everyone's account sizes are too. Chart analysis may give an indications of a direction. You can choose when you wish to enter, and when to exit. You don't have to enter the trade when we send it.

        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-base mb-2">When to close trades:</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Our chart analysis is an indication of direction in which a pair may go, but markets change second by second, and there are going to be times where the price reaches close to the Targets but doesn't quite. This is why we say, 'keep an eye on your trades and close when you're happy with the profit you've made'. A target is never a guarantee that the price will hit this figure, but is an informed indication of where we think it may reach.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            There are also going to be scenarios where your trades start to go negative and in to Red. This is completely normal and you shouldn't panic. Emotions can get the better of you in trading and can cause you losses. Just remember, 'it's not a loss until you lock it in as one'. This can be managed by using appropriate lot sizes. Please see the pinned message regarding lot sizes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="font-bold text-base mb-2">Lot sizes:</h3>
          <p>
            Lot sizes pay a crucial role in forex trading as they are your primary method of risk management. Again, it is entirely your choice as to how much you choose to trade with, but as a general rule of thumb, you should only ever risk 1-2% of your account per trade. You should never be in a position where you're having to close trades because you don't have enough margin in your account. If this is happening, you're lot sizes are too big and you're risking too much.
